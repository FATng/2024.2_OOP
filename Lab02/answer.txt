Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?


Answer: Yes, JAVA allows you to create multiple constructors in a class, a concept known as constructor overloading. This works because each constructor has a different parameter list, allowing JAVA to differentiate between them. For  example in the exercise "Overloaded Constructors in DigitalVideoDisc": 
- When you call new DigitalVideoDisc("Jungle Book"), JAVA matches it with the constructor that takes a single String argument and assigns it to title.
- When you call new DigitalVideoDisc("Animation", true), JAVA matches it with the constructor that takes a String and a boolean, and assigns the string to category.


Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?


Answer: JAVA is strictly pass-by-value.

When passing objects, Java passes the reference by value, which means the reference itself is copied, so any changes to the reference inside the method do not affect the original reference. However, modifications to the object itself are reflected outside the method because both the original and copied references point to the same object.
